# IT Salary Survey (Exploratory Data Analysis Project)
This GitHub repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that aims to analyze, clean, and gain insights from a given dataset. The project utilizes Python programming language and various data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Feature Engine.

## Overview
In this project, we perform an in-depth exploratory analysis of a dataset to understand its structure, patterns, and relationships between variables. The goal is to extract meaningful information and generate visualizations that facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- [x] Data Acquisition: Download the dataset from Kaggle.
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/2020-it-salary-survey-for-eu-region) and save it to a local directory.

- [x] Data Loading: Explore the structure of the DataFrame by examining the column names, data types, and initial rows.
    
- [x] Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Identify columns with missing values Handle duplicate data.
      
- [x] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct preliminary data exploration, and calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation. Visualize the data using plots and charts to identify patterns and relationships.

- [x] Visualization: Utilize matplotlib or other visualization libraries to create informative and visually appealing plots.

- [x] Conclusion: Summarize the key findings and insights obtained from the data analysis. 

- [x] README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, including instructions on how to set up the environment, run the code, and reproduce the analysis.
